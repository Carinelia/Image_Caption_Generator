#  Image_Caption_Generator

A modular, Streamlit-powered app that generates natural language captions for uploaded images using a pretrained BLIP model. Built with PyTorch and designed for clarity, scalability, and sharing.

Upload an image and get a descriptive caption in seconds.

##  Technologies Used 

* Python 3.x
* Streamlit
* Libraries:
  
  * `PyTorch`
  * `transformers`
  * `Pillow`
  * `requests`
  * `os`
  * `io`
    
* Model:

   BLIP (Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) via Hugging Face

##  Model

Uses the [BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining)](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP) model for zero-shot image captioning. The model is loaded via Hugging Face Transformers and optimized for inference.

##  Setup

1. Clone the repo  
2. Create a virtual environment  
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

##  Dependencies

- `PyTorch`
- `transformers`
- `streamlit`
- `Pillow`
- `requests`


##  Future Improvements

- Add support for multiple captions per image  
- Integrate image enhancement or resizing  
- Deploy via Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud  
- Add drag-and-drop upload and caption history
